### Hi there!
I am a dedicated tech expert who constantly strives for development. I always prioritize high quality and pay attention to every detail in my tasks. Throughout my training process, I have mastered the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications, REST API testing, writing test cases, defect reporting, and creating detailed test reports. I also have knowledge in MySQL, enabling me to effectively analyze data. I draw conclusions flawlessly and present the best solutions, which is an additional asset in my approach to assigned tasks.
